# Welcome To My Page! ðŸ‘œ
I am Robin and you can access my profile from this link - https://github.com/Rapparicio

I have always considered myself a lifelong learner.  I have been willing to take on big things and to learn from my mistakes.  So when first introduced to the concept of the growth mindset, I thought that this concept was perfectly aligned with what I believed myself to be.  However, when I examined it more closely, I saw that it went beyond my thinking.  It includes actions beyond just learning.  For example, I did not think of celebrating someone else's win as a chance for me to be inspired by it to move me forward.  I would just be willing to celebrate them.  The growth mindset is a set of principles that drive positive action and personal and professional action.  The things that can hold me back are how I react to challenges, obstacles, or criticism.  The opposite is true; the things that will spire me forward are my reactions to these things aforementioned.  **Can I take criticism and learn from it?  Am I willing to continue with something to its completions?** 

##### To Keep A Growth Mindset:
  - Do not fight against a challenging concept; take it head-on and don't complain about it.
  - The adage is true -  *Hard work is its own reward.*
  - Lifelong learners take a risk.
  
# Learning Blog

The first few assignments have been about understanding the need for a growth mindset when it comes to learning something new.  In this case I am learning the basics about 
software development.  It is important to concentrate on the various elements of basic coding in order to set up your web page successfully.  This learning blog is designed highlight some key things. Important elements that go beyond what can be googled. 

## Setting up my pages - Markdowns
According to guides.github.com, > Markdowns are ways to style on the web.> This is an opportunity to use your creative expression.  You decide how your pages will look, 
using bold, italic, lists, bullets, or uploading images.
- [Using the non-alphabetic characters like # or *](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

This is the second page that I have set up in the repository in order to learn by doing.  I am learning how to set up a functioning page with provides the information in a systematic way.   I can optimize the look of my pages by using GitHub pages.

Get comfortable with GitHub
- Typing the @ symbol followed by someone's name will alert them to your project this is useful for teams and for other people you want to view your site. 
- To create a paragraph, live a blank line between the text.

## Chose Text Editors 
Software that is available for download to help write and manage text.  This is incredibly useful according to the article by The Older Coder. 

***What features should you look for in a text editor? I would say some of the most important features are:***

- code completion; 
- syntax highlighting; 
- a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); and 
- the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them. 
You might find some other features that are must-haveâ€™s, but I think these features are a good start.


The way one codes is very individualised like a signature.  And the selection of a text editor should be based on needs and ways in which the coder feel most comfortable.  Computers like mine have a built in editor but there are lot of different editors to choose from - Notepad, TextWrangler, BB Edits, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, as well as Sublime Text.

***IDE- Integrated Development Environment*** 
  1. This is a string of software pulled together, it is an all in one.  
  1. Pulling together features one may like from different text editing softwares.
