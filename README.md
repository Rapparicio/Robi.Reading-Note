# Welcome To My Page! ðŸ‘œ
I am Robin and you can access my profile from this link - https://github.com/Rapparicio

I have always considered myself a lifelong learner.  I have been willing to take on big things and to learn from my mistakes.  So when first introduced to the concept of the growth mindset, I thought that this concept was perfectly aligned with what I believed myself to be.  However, when I examined it more closely, I saw that it went beyond my thinking.  It includes actions beyond just learning.  For example, I did not think of celebrating someone else's win as a chance for me to be inspired by it to move me forward.  I would just be willing to celebrate them.  The growth mindset is a set of principles that drive positive action and personal and professional action.  The things that can hold me back are how I react to challenges, obstacles, or criticism.  The opposite is true; the things that will spire me forward are my reactions to these things aforementioned.  **Can I take criticism and learn from it?  Am I willing to continue with something to its completions?** 

##### To Keep A Growth Mindset:
  - Do not fight against a challenging concept; take it head-on and don't complain about it.
  - The adage is true -  *Hard work is its own reward.*
  - Lifelong learners take a risk.
